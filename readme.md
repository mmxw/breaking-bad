## Breaking Bad Characters and Their Endings
A fun project showing all the characters of Breaking Bad in each episode, and (sadly) how they die.

### Project Technical Requirements

Your app must:
* **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
* **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

### User Story: 
- user can navigate through different seasons and different episodes of breaking bad
- user can search characters, their quotes and deaths, by typing their name in the search bar and the filtered results will be displayed in real time

### Design Process:
